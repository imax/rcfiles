USAGE                                                      *bufexplorer-usage*

To start exploring in the current window, use: >
 \be  or  :BufExplorer
To start exploring in a newly split window, use: >
 \bs  or  :SBufExplorer

Note: If the current buffer is modified, the current window is always
      split.

Command to use once exploring:

 <cr> or       Opens the buffer that is under the cursor into the current
 <leftmouse>   window.
 d             Deletes the buffer from the list that is under the cursor.
 p             Toggles the showing of a split filename/pathname.
 q             Quit exploring.
 s             Selects the order the buffers are listed in. Either by their
               name, by their number or by most recently used.
 r             Reverses the order the buffers are listed in.
 ?             Displays help information.

Typically one would put bufexplorer.vim into the .vim/plugin directory
(vimfiles\plugin for Windows) where it becomes automatically available
for use. It sets up it's default keymaps to use \be and \bs. If you would
like to use something other than '\', you may simply change the leader
(see |mapleader|).

Once invoked, Buffer Explorer display a sorted list of all the buffers
that are currently opened. You are then able to move the cursor to the
line containing the buffer's name you are wanting to act upon. Once you
have selected the buffer you would like, you can then either open it,
close it(delete), resort the list, reverse the sort, quit exploring
and so on...

You can avoid loading this plugin by setting the "loaded_bufexplorer"
variable: >
  :let loaded_bufexplorer = 1

         the bufexplorer was opened.

Credit must go out to Bram Moolenaar and all the Vim developers for
making the world's best editor (IMHO). I also want to thank everyone who
help and gave me suggestions. I wouldn't want to leave anyone out so I
won't list names.
